  Q1 : 1. Mention the difference between interpreter and compiler.

    Solution : 
                    Compiler

         1. Compliers reads the source code, outputs executable code
         2. Translates software written in a higher-level language into instructions that computer can understand.
         3. It converts the text that a programmer writes into a format the CPU can understand.
         4. The process of compilation is relatively complicated. It spends a lot of time analyzing and processing the program.
         5. The executable result is some form of machine-specific binary code.

                  Interpreter

         1. The interpreter converts the source code line-by-line during RUN Time.
         2. Interpret completely translates a program written in a high-level language into machine level language.
         3. Interpreter allows evaluation and modification of the program while it is executing.
         4. Relatively less time spent for analyzing and processing the program
         5. Program execution is relatively slow compared to compiler
